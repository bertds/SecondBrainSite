<h2 id="problems-ai-models-after-deployment">Problems AI models after deployment</h2>

<p>(Andrew Ng)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some engineers think that when you deploy an AI system, you’re done. But when you first deploy, you may only be halfway to the goal. Substantial work lies ahead in monitoring and maintaining the system. Here are some reasons why:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li><strong>Data drift.</strong> The model was trained on a certain distribution of inputs, but this distribution changes over time. For example, a model may have learned to estimate demand for electricity from historical data, but climate change is causing unprecedented changes to weather, so the model’s accuracy degrades._</li>
  <li>_<strong>Concept drift.</strong> The model was trained to learn an_ x_->_y _mapping, but the statistical relationship between_ x _and_ y _changes, so the same input_ x _now demands a different prediction_ y_. For example, a model that predicts housing prices based on square footage will lose accuracy as inflation causes prices to rise._</li>
  <li>_<strong>Changing requirements.</strong> The model was built to perform a particular task, but the product team decides to modify its capabilities. For instance, a model detects construction workers who wander into a dangerous area without a hard hat for more than 5 seconds. But safety requirements change, and now it must flag hatless workers who enter the area for more than 3 seconds. (This issue sometimes manifests as concept drift, but I put it in a different category because it’s often driven by changes in the product specification rather than changes in the world.)  </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Detecting concept and data drift is challenging, because AI systems have unclear boundary conditions. For traditional software, boundary conditions — the range of valid inputs — are usually easy to specify. But for AI software trained on a given data distribution, it’s challenging to recognize when the data distribution has changed sufficiently to compromise performance._</p>
