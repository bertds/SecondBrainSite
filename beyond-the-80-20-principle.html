<p>Work is about insight, not hours put in. Wealth creation is 1 percent perspiration and 99 percent inspiration. Intuition is more important than rational analysis. ♦ Business is driven by ideas and information. The best ideas create the most money. The best ideas are infinitely recyclable.<br />

<p>that there was competition for life between individuals and that traits were conserved through their relative adaptability to life’s conditions.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 557</p>

<p>Natural selection: the key to life The process is very simple: variation, then selection, then further variation. Then more variation, more selection, more variation. And so on back to the start of life and forward to eternity. This is how species evolve.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 558</p>

<p>There will thus be a continual process of improvement or better adaptation to the environment<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 564</p>

<p>Darwin suggested that the more species there were on a piece of land, the more efficiently the land would be used.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 574</p>

<p>Diversity works. It always leads to even greater diversity, and to sustainable growth. If we want to sum up the theory of evolution by natural selection in two words, which have great relevance for all societies and businesses, we should simply remember: diversity works.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 592</p>

<p>For Lamarck, species evolve to survive; for Darwin, species naturally evolve, and the environment decides whether or not they survive.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 643</p>

<p>a business or a career is failing, there are only two remedies: to change the environment, or to change the character of the business or the individual. Markets usually evolve by changing the winners<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 645</p>

<p>Natural selection is a process of experimentation in which luck is paramount. So is business.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 653</p>

<p>The clue: create a new segment, based on greater specialization. Take one market or industry and make it two. This opportunity always exists—it is the way that markets must evolve, and all that is required to realize a new segment is imagination allied to the following simple method.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 668</p>

<p>Products live in families, both vertically (over time) and horizontally (at the same time). Products live in a generation game. All products will eventually die, but the most successful products will live long enough to generate at least one ‘offspring,’ a next-generation product or a same-generation variant. The most successful products will generate many of both. For every successful product, however, there will be many that never got off the drawing board, never survived the test market, died shortly after launch, or never produced any offspring.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 684</p>

<p>The third lesson, therefore, is to scatter new breeds around your core product: fill up the potential product spaces so that newcomers can’t move into these niches.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 724</p>

<p>The fourth lesson is that product and service improvement can and should always be accelerated.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 737</p>

<p>Pay close attention, therefore, to even so-called marginal customer preferences. Over time, they will count.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 783</p>

<p>Fisher’s theorem predicts that markets, products, brands, technologies, companies and individuals who improve their fit with the environment faster (than other markets…) will expand faster and be more profitable.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 791</p>

<p>On its own, growth does not necessarily represent success: many firms perversely choose to grow products and businesses that the market does not particularly like. The market typically takes its revenge by ensuring that the growth is profitless.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 812</p>

<p>The ‘best’ products (or companies, or executives) don’t necessarily rise to the top.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 834</p>

<p>The implications? Don’t buck the market, even if you’re sure that it’s wrong. If the market feedback on a product or service is negative, trash it.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 842</p>

<p>Remember the old motto: the customer is always right. So is the market, even when it is ‘unfair’ or ‘wrong.’<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 844</p>

<p>If we realize that failure is normal, we come to view all business as an experiment, where success at the first attempt is not to be expected.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 851</p>

<p>Whatever our failures, and however bad they are, spectacular success may lurk around the corner—given certain conditions, and with a lot of luck.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 852</p>

<p>If this attempt fails, fear not. It is time to start another business, using the best parts of the experience, contacts and skills from the existing one.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 871</p>

<p>The same principle applies to individuals. If your career is not making satisfactory progress, it is time to change the environment: get out of your existing business into a new one.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 872</p>

<p>Evolution obeys three principles. Differentiation emerges from generality. Each new differentiation then turns into a generality, from which new differentiations emerge. And development depends on co-development: species evolve more fully when other species co-evolve, and, as Darwin said, ‘all forms of life make together one grand system.’<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 878</p>

<p>The only way to win is to be exposed to competition, to pursue variation relentlessly and continuously, to accept the environment’s verdict, to be quick—and to be lucky!<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 887</p>

<p>New products and services will emerge from somewhere: from you or from competitors.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 889</p>

<p>Therefore leave no niche unfilled, no potential niche exposed to innovation from new competitors. Cannibalize your own products and markets before you are cannibalized by others. Product and service improvements can always be accelerated.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 890</p>

<p>Action implications ♦ Vary, reinvent, multiply, and vary again. Continuously evolve everything in your business life—your products and services, your ideas, your technologies, your teams, your corporation, your collaborators, yourself. Evolution requires experimentation, variation, rejection of inferior or less well-received variants, hard driving to multiply the successful variants, and a commitment to further cycles of experimentation, variation, selection, and multiplication of the few winners. ♦ Pursue evolutionary cycles repetitively, so that the quest for continual improvement via experimentation becomes routine. ♦ Expose product ideas and products to full-bore competition. ♦ Scatter product variants around your core products. Fill up the potential product space. ♦ Drive successes as hard and fast as possible. Ensure that they have prolific sex lives. ♦ Always accept the market’s verdict, even when you consider it unfair. Don’t give new projects or failing products or businesses the benefit of the doubt. ♦ Only expect to have a few winners—but get the most out of them. Welcome your failures. ♦ If you are faced with a failing business or a failing career, quit! Find a different environment, and change your character to fit the new environment better than any rival. ♦ Keep reminding yourself that diversity works.<br />

<p>Business genetics for executives—six action rules ♦ Use the best business genes available<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,200</p>

<p>Make yourself an excellent vehicle for successful business genes<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,208</p>

<p>Use the best vehicles available and drive them<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />

<p>Career evolution requires variation: a series of new jobs (whether or not you change firms) and new ways of doing the existing job<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,218</p>

<p>Evolution requires continual experimentation and improvement<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,220</p>

<p>Evolution requires failure<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,225</p>

<p>Action implications ♦ Identify business genes that are underexploited and that are having to make do with poor vehicles. Create the best new vehicles for existing powerful business genes—for valuable economic information, ways of working, and technologies. ♦ join existing successful business genes into new combinations, and provide appropriate vehicles for the new combinations. ♦ Make yourself the best vehicle for a winning and unique combination of business genes. ♦ If you participate in running an organization, realize that its value derives from being a vehicle for successful business genes. Ensure that the organization is and remains the best vehicle for the genes. See that the organization’s gene pool is continually replenished with new inputs that have already proven their success. ♦ Create spin-offs and spin-outs from existing organizations.<br />

<p>Gause’s Principle of Survival by Differentiation,<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,284</p>

<p>So your firm needs unique niches, places where no one else can go because they aren’t exactly like you.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,318</p>

<p>The ‘places’ can be particular customers, geographic markets, channels of distribution, products, technologies, or any other source of differentiation, but at least one of these must be unique to your firm. Otherwise you are the same species as your competitor, slugging it out in the market equivalent of Gause’s glass jar.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,318</p>

<p>if your firm can invade and the competitor can’t, you should. You can feel very confident of the outcome.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,340</p>

<p>Coexistence is real competition, where either can invade the other. Bi-stability is when they can’t; it’s illusory competition.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,343</p>

<p>you’re in a market where there is only one dimension of competition, and you’re not the best on that dimension, you should create a separate segment where another dimension matters. If you can’t do this, and the market is unprofitable for you (as it probably will be, if you’re measuring the profitability properly), then you should quit.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,372</p>

<p>Differentiation is not a description of a state; it is a set of actions to increase differences.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,380</p>

<p>further differentiate your firm from its closest competitor (in each area where you face a different ‘closest competitor’) along each of the following four dimensions: ♦ customer type ♦ type of product or service ♦ geography ♦ stage of value added.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,381</p>

<p>Gause’s Principle of Survival by Differentiation tells us that we cannot expect to prosper if we make our living in the same way at the same time in the same place as another similar competitor.<br />
<a href="yellow-highlight.html">Yellow highlight</a><br />
Location: 1,386</p>

<p>Differentiate. Specialize. Put all your energy and resources into areas where you are substantially different from any rival. ♦ Systematically increase the degree of difference from your closest rival, along the four dimensions of product/service type, customer type, geographic market, and stage of value added. Aim to become unique; that is, to have no rivals. ♦ Get out of businesses where a competitor can invade you but you can’t invade it. ♦ If you can invade a competitor, but it can’t invade you, go ahead and invade. ♦ Avoid businesses where there is coexistence: where everyone can snatch each other’s customers. If you’re in a coexistence market, turn it into a bi-stable one by finding a distinctive approach that customers like and competitors can’t imitate. If you can’t do this, and are stuck with coexistence, make the most of it by trying not to step on competitors’ toes. ♦ In any business where a single purchase criterion (such as price, or quality, or service) is all that matters, and you are the best at satisfying that criterion, go all out for dominance. Widen the gap between yourself and competitors on that criterion. If you are in such a business, yet are not the best at meeting the key criterion and cannot become the best at it, then find another segment (within or outside your current segment) where the purchase criterion plays to your strength. If you can’t find such a segment, exit.<br />
