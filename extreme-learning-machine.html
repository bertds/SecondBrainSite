<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it ?</h2>

<p>An ELM architecture is composed of two layers; the first is randomly initialized and fixed, whereas the second is trainable. Essentially, the network randomly projects the data into a new space and performs a multiple regression (then passing it through an output activation function, of course). The random projection entails a dimensionality reduction (or enlargement) method, which multiplies random matrices by the input — although the idea may sound odd, pulling randomly from strategic distributions can actually work very well (as we’ll see with an intuitive analogy later). It applies a random distortion of sorts that applies noise — in a good way, if done correctly — and lets the remainder of the network to adapt, opening up new doors in terms of learning opportunities.</p>

<h2 id="keynotes">Keynotes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Extreme Learning Machines use a fixed, random first layer and a trainable second layer. This is essentially a random projection, followed by a multiple regression.</li>
<li>Proponents say that ELMs are able to learn with very few examples very quickly in simpler scenarios (like MNIST), with the advantage of being very easy to program and without the burden of needing to choose parameters like the architecture, optimizers, and losses. On the other hand, opponents argue that an SVM would be better in those scenarios, that ELM is unsuitable for more complex problems, and that it is simply a rebranding of a very old idea.</li>
<li>ELMs generally do not perform well on complex tasks, but the fact that it can perform well on simpler tasks is a good reason to explore more the world of lightweight architectures, non-backpropagation model fitting, and random projections. At the very least, the Extreme Learning Machine — or whatever name you would like to brand the idea under — is an interesting idea that every deep learning enthusiast should know.</li>
