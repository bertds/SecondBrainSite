<p>The hard question is: are you willing to spend a lot of computation time and obtain poor results, or do you prefer to spend a hell of a lot of computation time and obtain good results? There is no free lunch in science.</p>

<p>So let us discuss scientific issues. Assume you have a 10-class problem, with roughly the same number N of examples in each class. If you adopt the n-vs-rest approach, you will have to design 10 classifiers that are supposed to discriminate a class with N examples from the "rest" class, which has 9</p>

<p>N examples. Then a stupid classifier (called zero-classifier) that always assigns all examples to the "rest" class will have a wonderful accuracy of 90%. This means that accuracy alone is a meaningless performance index in such a case; but this is essentially the quantity that is optimized during training. This makes the class imbalance problem rather tricky. In thirty years of reviewing papers I have encountered scores of papers describing classifiers whose accuracy was great - but way lower than the accuracy of the zero-classifier! And there are hundreds of published papers that have exactly the same problem.</p>

<p>By contrast, if you turn to binary classifiers, you will have to design 45 classifiers with balanced classes. And, as additional bonuses, you can (i) select the relevant features for each classifier, because it happens very frequently that the relevant features for discriminating class A from class B are different from the relevant features for discriminating A from C, (ii) select the optimal complexity for each classifier. Furthermore, if you use binary classifiers that estimate the posterior probability of the classes (e.g. neural networks with sigmoid outputs), you can easily derive the posterior probability of each class from the pairwise posterior probabilities.</p>
