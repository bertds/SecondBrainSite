      <div id="content"><p>"The Design of Everyday Things: Revised and Expanded Edition" by Don Norman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Designers need to focus their attention on the cases where things go wrong, not just on when things work as planned. Actually, this is where the most satisfaction can arise: when something goes wrong but the machine highlights the problems, then the person understands the issue, takes the proper actions, and the problem is solved. When this happens smoothly, the collaboration of person and device feels wonderful."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The moral was simple: we were designing things for people, so we needed to understand both technology and people. But that’s a difficult step for many engineers: machines are so logical, so orderly. If we didn’t have people, everything would work so much better."</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>"Great designers produce pleasurable experiences. Experience: note the word."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>C.G. Jung</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"If the path before you is clear, you're probably on someone else's."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Fifty Things that Made the Modern Economy" by  - Tim Harford</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The Luddites weren’t worried about being replaced by machines: they were worried about being replaced by the cheaper, less-skilled workers whom the machines would empower. So whenever a new technology emerges, it’s worth trying to ask who will win and who will lose out as a result. The answer can often surprise us."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don Norman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The future cannot be predicted, not even by trying to invent it. Although inventions can change the future, their long-term impact cannot be predicted." </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Get over your fear by getting focused, committed, and determined. Listening to a podcast recently the speaker shared how her daughter’s martial arts teacher got her refocused in a moment of fear. He said, “Get your butterflies flying in formation.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://youtu.be/wD2cVhC-63I?t=207">Matthew McConaughey Oscar’s acceptance speech</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>“Who’s your hero?” they asked.</strong><br />
  I said I thought about it. You know who it is? It’s me in 10 years. So I turned 25. Ten years later, that same person comes to me and says, “So, are you a hero?” And I was like, “not even close. No, no, no.” She said, “Why?” I said, “Because my hero’s me at 35.” So you see every day, every week, every month and every year of my life, my hero’s always 10 years away. I’m never gonna be my hero. I’m not gonna attain that. I know I’m not, and that’s just fine with me because that keeps me with somebody to keep on chasing. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, French writer and pioneering aviator</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.”</p>
