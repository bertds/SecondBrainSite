<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>Worldview is, according to Shepherd, shaped by biases, literacy and misinformation. Biases : confirmatio bias (find evidence that supports your believe) , Dunning-Kruger (people think they know more than they do and underestimate what they don't know), cognitive dissonance (). The literacy and misinformation comes from the box we live in, the sources a use for our information about science and life</p>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>I think that one thing that shapes perceptions in the public, about science, is belief systems and biases.  I want to talk about three elements of that: confirmation bias, Dunning-Kruger effect and cognitive dissonance. </p>

<h3 id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation bias</h3>

<p>Finding evidence that supports what we already believe.</p>

<h3 id="dunning-kruger">Dunning-Kruger</h3>

<p>Two scholars from Cornell came up with the Dunning-Kruger effect. If you go look up the peer-reviewed paper for this, you will see all kinds of fancy terminology: it's an illusory superiority complex, thinking we know things. In other words, people think they know more than they do. Or they underestimate what they don't know.</p>

<h3 id="cognitive-dissonance">Cognitive dissonance</h3>

<p>We just recently had Groundhog Day, right? Now, there's no better definition of cognitive dissonance than intelligent people asking me if a rodent's forecast is accurate.<br />
The term cognitive dissonance is used to describe theÂ mental discomfort that results from holding two conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes. People tend to seek consistency in their attitudes and perceptions, so this conflict causes feelings of unease or discomfort.<br />
This inconsistency between what people believe and how they behave motivates people to engage in actions that will help minimize feelings of discomfort. People attempt to relieve this tension in different ways, such as by rejecting, explaining away, or avoiding new information.</p>

<p>There's literacy and misinformation that keep us boxed in. The reality is, we all struggle with perceiving something outside of our experience level.<br />
So belief systems and biases, literacy and misinformation. How do we step out of the boxes that are cornering our perceptions?</p>

<p>You take inventory of your own biases. Where do they come from? Your upbringing, your political perspective, your faith -- what shapes your own biases? Then, evaluate your sources -- where do you get your information on science? What do you read, what do you listen to, to consume your information on science? </p>
